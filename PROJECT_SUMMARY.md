# SoLearn Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
SoLearn is a decentralized learning platform based on the Solana blockchain, designed to incentivize users to learn blockchain and Web3-related knowledge through a "Learn-to-Earn" model. The platform provides high-quality course content, and learners can earn $LEARN tokens as rewards after completing courses and quizzes. This project combines education and blockchain technology to create a sustainable learning ecosystem.
