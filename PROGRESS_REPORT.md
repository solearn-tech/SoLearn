## Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges

1. **Solana Transaction Confirmation Time**
   - **Challenge**: After users complete courses, they need to wait for Solana transaction confirmation to see rewards
   - **Solution**: Implement optimistic UI updates, showing expected results in the frontend while asynchronously confirming in the background

2. **Video Content Loading Performance**
   - **Challenge**: Course video content is large, affecting page loading speed
   - **Solution**: Implement progressive loading and adaptive quality based on user network conditions

3. **Cross-device Learning Progress Synchronization**
   - **Challenge**: Need to maintain consistent learning progress across multiple devices
   - **Solution**: Implement a hybrid storage model with blockchain-based progress verification and centralized database

### Product Challenges

1. **Token Economy Model Balance**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring token rewards are both incentivizing and economically sustainable
   - **Solution**: Design dynamic reward algorithms adjusting based on course difficulty, quality ratings, and platform activity

2. **Content Quality Assurance**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring platform course content accuracy and educational value
   - **Solution**: Implement community review mechanisms and expert verification processes

## Next Steps (Sprint 4)

### Development Focus
1. Complete reward system frontend and backend integration
2. Optimize user learning experience and progress tracking
3. Implement basic community features (comments, ratings)
4. Begin development of course creator portal

### Product Milestones
- Internal beta release (expected within 2 weeks)
- Community beta recruitment (expected within 4 weeks)
- Creator portal alpha testing (expected within 6 weeks)

## Technical Debt and Optimization Plan

### Identified Technical Debt
1. Some components need refactoring for better reusability
2. API error handling needs standardization
3. Frontend type definitions are incomplete

### Optimization Plan
1. Allocate 20% of time during Sprint 4 for technical debt repayment
2. Establish more comprehensive automated test coverage
3. Optimize build process to reduce package size

## Team Collaboration and Process Improvement

1. Implement bi-weekly sprint planning and retrospectives
2. Optimize code review process to ensure quality standards
3. Strengthen frontend and backend development collaboration to reduce integration friction

## Summary

The SoLearn project development is progressing well, with the core functional framework largely established. The frontend user interface is attractive and feature-rich, while the backend API structure is clear and has good extensibility. The biggest challenges are in blockchain integration and reward system implementation, which the team is actively addressing.

The next phase will focus on completing the reward system loop, optimizing user experience, and beginning community feature development. We are confident in delivering the first usable version of the product within the planned timeframe.
