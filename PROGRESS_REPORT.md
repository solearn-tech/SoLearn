   - In progress: Player interaction optimization
   - In progress: Offline learning support

2. **User Learning Dashboard**
   - Completed basic layout and design
   - In progress: Learning statistics display
   - In progress: Achievements and rewards display
   - Not started: Learning recommendation feature

3. **Mobile Adaptation**
   - Completed basic responsive layout
   - In progress: Touch interaction optimization
   - Not started: Mobile performance optimization

### Backend Development Progress (Sprint 3)
The current iteration focuses on improving APIs and integrating blockchain functionality:

1. **API Optimization**
   - Completed basic API caching
   - In progress: API performance optimization
   - In progress: Error handling and logging

2. **Blockchain Integration**

   - In progress: Token reward distribution
   - Not started: Achievement NFT minting

## Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges

1. **Solana Transaction Confirmation Time**
   - **Challenge**: After users complete courses, they need to wait for Solana transaction confirmation to see rewards
   - **Solution**: Implement optimistic UI updates, showing expected results in the frontend while asynchronously confirming in the background

2. **Video Content Loading Performance**
   - **Challenge**: Course video content is large, affecting page loading speed
   - **Solution**: Implement progressive loading and adaptive quality based on user network conditions

3. **Cross-device Learning Progress Synchronization**
   - **Challenge**: Need to maintain consistent learning progress across multiple devices
   - **Solution**: Implement a hybrid storage model with blockchain-based progress verification and centralized database

### Product Challenges

1. **Token Economy Model Balance**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring token rewards are both incentivizing and economically sustainable
   - **Solution**: Design dynamic reward algorithms adjusting based on course difficulty, quality ratings, and platform activity

2. **Content Quality Assurance**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring platform course content accuracy and educational value
   - **Solution**: Implement community review mechanisms and expert verification processes

## Next Steps (Sprint 4)

### Development Focus
1. Complete reward system frontend and backend integration
2. Optimize user learning experience and progress tracking
3. Implement basic community features (comments, ratings)
4. Begin development of course creator portal

### Product Milestones
- Internal beta release (expected within 2 weeks)
- Community beta recruitment (expected within 4 weeks)
- Creator portal alpha testing (expected within 6 weeks)

## Technical Debt and Optimization Plan

### Identified Technical Debt
1. Some components need refactoring for better reusability
2. API error handling needs standardization
3. Frontend type definitions are incomplete

### Optimization Plan
1. Allocate 20% of time during Sprint 4 for technical debt repayment
2. Establish more comprehensive automated test coverage
3. Optimize build process to reduce package size

## Team Collaboration and Process Improvement

1. Implement bi-weekly sprint planning and retrospectives
2. Optimize code review process to ensure quality standards
3. Strengthen frontend and backend development collaboration to reduce integration friction

## Summary

The SoLearn project development is progressing well, with the core functional framework largely established. The frontend user interface is attractive and feature-rich, while the backend API structure is clear and has good extensibility. The biggest challenges are in blockchain integration and reward system implementation, which the team is actively addressing.

The next phase will focus on completing the reward system loop, optimizing user experience, and beginning community feature development. We are confident in delivering the first usable version of the product within the planned timeframe.

# Project Progress Report - Code Cleanup and Internationalization

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Cleanup
- Removed Chinese comments from source code files
- Replaced placeholder comments with meaningful English documentation
- Improved code readability with better structured comments
- Ensured consistent coding style across components

### 2. Directory Structure Reorganization
- Verified and documented the project structure in README.md
- Added detailed descriptions of each directory's purpose
- Ensured logical organization of code components

### 3. Internationalization Support
- Created and improved internationalization scripts:
  - `detect_chinese.sh`: New script to scan for Chinese characters in the codebase
  - `replace_chinese.sh`: Enhanced with better documentation
  - `deep_replace_chinese.sh`: Improved with clearer comments
- Added internationalization section to README.md
- Ensured all user-facing content is in English

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Enhanced README.md with more detailed project structure information
- Added internationalization documentation
- Improved code comments for better developer understanding
- Ensured all documentation follows consistent formatting

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any remaining non-English content
2. Implement proper i18n framework for future multi-language support
3. Add automated tests for internationalization compliance
4. Create contribution guidelines for maintaining language consistency

## Summary

The project has been successfully cleaned up and internationalized. All Chinese content has been either removed or properly documented where necessary for reference purposes. The codebase now follows consistent English-only standards, making it more accessible to international developers and contributors.
